    <h2>An Important Note Related to the Project</h2>
    <p>This project in total represents the makings of a user maintainable form of ID, and with its’ controls - such as those derived from features of Ethereum’s platform – viewers may have a great deal of assurance that its’ content is presented as the
      user intended. This web page (https://jint-intj.github.io/emblem-homepage/) is a bootstrapped temporary homepage for the project. The emblem project is under version control, and its’ current state can be viewed at the following URL: https://github.com/Jint-Intj/emblem.
      A video that provides a visual demonstration of the app, my upcoming activities related to the emblem's repo, and more can be viewed at the following URL: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwbLKNAzuL2oPQlcaSV501B-R8gh_UF8a. Developers are the video’s target audience,
      and I look forward to receiving any form feedback at my handles below – ideally on my Instagram handle. I will strive to log inclusive notes related to both the app and my endeavor described below on a frequent basis at the following URL: https://jint-intj.github.io/emblem-homepage/public/my-notepad.pdf.
      In a lot ways, the current use of an externally owned address (EOA), which could ultimately associate with the emblem's contract address upon creation already entails an effective means for a user to maintain an emblem. That’s not a challenge to
      developers to prove otherwise just yet - take it easy on the kid if you like my karma! The text listed below this extra long note represents the final view the application within the emblem repo renders into a client’s Chrome browser upon meeting
      a few verification controls associated to data points herein. Lastly, the overall concept for the text under the Jint’s Endeavor header tag is to provide context as to what a user aspires to accomplish with his or hers emblem. I’ve structured mine
      similarly. I value the K.I.S.S. principal, and I hope this project has that sort of feel so far. Thanks!--Jint-Intj</p>

  <h2>An Overview of Jint’s Endeavor (12 minute read)</h2>
  <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThank you for visiting Jint’s Emblem. The name Jint represents a pen name of mine, and the application that I created to render this single page of HTML code is closely related to my endeavor: to advance good governance administrative
    controls - by way of my pen name’s authorship activities - for organizations that adhere to tax-exempt purposes within the United States of America. I will often refer to these organizations as EOs, remaining mindful of many permissible purposes:
    namely, scientific, literary, educational, and charitable. As a whole, this application’s design is intended to serve as form of ID for my pen name and a method of control over it specifically for me. Although it’s modular in this sense, I intend
    for the data rendered into this view remain largely as presented. However, there are some exceptions that come to mind. Those mostly being the version control tag, and potentially other fields of data that are presented above the title of this overview.
    Those exceptions in total entail a means of recovery for me. A complete overview of my endeavor will be accessible at the following url: [Coming soon! While this overview details a problem, the complete overview will describe potential solutions.].
    The remainder of this overview will be structured into a discussion about me, an observation that functions as a premise for my endeavor, and lastly my maturation of a business-model named SHUI that’s not an ICO as a practical means to advance the
    stated endeavor.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFirstly, I will provide some information about me. Considering the setting, it’s perhaps important to state that I’m a person rather than a computer application. I have a bachelor’s degree in general business, which specialized
    in entrepreneurship. At the moment this application was pre-released, my eight years of work experiences centered toward performing tasks within a number of EOs’ accounting environments. Although my use of a pen name may understandably be viewed as
    a precarious interest, considering both that I’m not a developer and also my aspiration to eventually perform tasks within programs of SHUI, I’m fairly certain my name will ultimately be discernible. This is ideal. I primarily using a pen name to
    steer clear of activities that could align with self-promotion and to realize a professional courtesy in respect to my publicly provided learning process. Authors often have editors and those editors often have editors as well. I will likely have
    neither, but will advance material with my endeavor namely in mind into public domain nonetheless.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe list of handles presented below the image above entail my approach to communicate with both developers and also non-developers such as myself. I intend for my communications to be exclusive to those handles. As of the date
    of my application’s pre-release, I only had roughly 2 months of experience coding. I aspire to be an exceptional Social Entrepreneur as opposed to a Developer, mostly because I recognize these terms as each respectable career paths.</p>
  <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe experiences I’ve gained over the course of years helped me frame an observation, which functions a lot like a fundamental premise for my endeavor. I observed that EOs may experience difficulties adopting administrative controls
    derived from open-source communities as a result of a demand to contemporaneously document the process in an arm’s-length manner with knowledgeable individuals. In an effort to make this observation logically draw in the form of an inference, I prepared
    a number of the following paragraphs.</p>
  <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe accounting equation that is often referenced as associative to separate legal entities will provide some perspective. Within a number of introductory textbooks related to accounting, the noted accounting equation is often
    demonstrated in the form of Assets = Liability + Equity, where the variable of equity is denoted in combination with words such as owner’s, shareholder’s, or even stockholder’s. Perhaps the most comparable accounting equation related to EOs in the
    US could be located within annual filings of Form 990 - denoting Assets = Liability + Net Assets. Essentially, in this context, no one person should own an equitable interest in an EO’s accounting equation. Overall, a significance of these concepts
    is a subtle shift in how EOs implement compelling strategic management plans. It’s a maneuver away from terms such as elevator pitch to a near representation of a scientific method. Hence, a perspective related to my previously stated observation.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI acknowledge the prior paragraph does require significant leaps in logic in order to draw an inference in support of my observation. It can be difficult to summarize an issue with a few statements, and such efforts more often
    than not achieve a disservice towards the interest. Perspective is helpful. Likewise, within the context of the observation, the concept of knowledgeable individuals may actually provide the most concise amount of background information in support
    of the challenge I perceive EO’s will face during efforts to adopt blockchain solutions. In general, it is easier to reach a common ground related to EOs use of knowledgeable individuals to advance their administrative proposals, although the meaning
    of knowledgeable is certainly subjective matter. Building upon this thought, within a publication of The Economist’s named The World in 2017, the author of an article titled Chain Reaction shares insights related to blockchain:</p>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p>The blockchain is a “distributed ledger”, an online record of transactions that is shared and authenticated through a series of cryptographic steps. If that sounds dull, it isn’t. A trusted register has the potential to cut fraud by verifying who
      actually owns an asset, whether it be a wodge of digital currency or a plot of land. It dangles the promise of huge cost savings: why spend time and money reconciling lots of proprietary databases when a single public version can do the job? And
      because it can have instructions embedded within it, the blockchain opens the door to “smart contracts” that can be executed automatically without the need for pesky humans to get involved. (Palmer 126)</p>
  </div>
  <p>Additionally, a 2015 technical report provided in association with Berkley University of California denotes an author’s view that blockchain should be considered as an invention of the likes of the steam or the combustion engine (2).</p>
  <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA few inferences can be portrayed with the prior two references largely in mind. Firstly, blockchain has stimulated a great deal of excitement in relation to its’ potential applications. In particular, the extension of blockchain’s
    use into smart contracts may very well represent a sizable field of study within academic settings in the near future. Secondly, the idea presented within The Economist excerpt above denoting that blockchain can function as a secure register, introduces
    the grounds for full arrangement of administrative controls that could be utilized by nearly any separate legal entity in existence today. It’s also worth noting that a fact sheet from the National Council of Nonprofits website indicates as of December
    2016, there were 1,202,719 public charities and private foundation in the United States – representing a considerable sector of organizations innovative controls of the likes of a secure register could be adopted by. Another forethought is that the
    commercialization of Blockchain solutions could arguably be stated as within its’ infancy, given referenced comparisons of the technology to that can classify as generational such as the steam engine. This has certainly been a mouthful, but its’ nearing
    in on perhaps a shared view of how the demand for EOs use of knowledgable individuals supports the observation that frames my endeavor.
  </p>

  <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAs with many innovations that can be classified as generational or even simply as prolific, there tends to be a period of time of which the innovation eventually becomes widely-held as a commodity good and/or service. This leads
    me to to drawing a comparison related to the commercialization of the Internet to that of blockchain solutions. A rather retrospective article titled The Past and Future History of the Internet dated in a 1997 publication, provides a comprehensive
    perspective of the internet nearly evolving into ‘commodity’ service within that year.</p>
  <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI have a hypothesis about the likely level of understanding large segments of society – in its’ broadest sense – would have in relation to any given prolific innovation over the course of its’ commercialization. In so many words,
    at the start of a generational innovation’s commercialization period, it is likely that large segments of society would have difficulty expressing in an impromptu manner both how the innovation works and also what it can be used for. Alternatively,
    once the innovation could be stated as representative of highly-saturated product and/or service throughout society, a pronounced population would likely still have a similar level of difficulty expressing how it works, but would likely instead be
    able to provide a staggering amount of qualitative data related to what the innovation can accurately be used for. Coordinating inquiries along these lines in the mid 1990’s in regards to the Internet could have produced the noted results. Nonetheless,
    roughly 3 decades since the noted period of the Internet’s commercialization, those coordinating those inquiries may result in only a frequent answers related to what the Internet can accurately be used for.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAdmittedly, at the very least this hypothesis can hold as feasible when purely taking into account my very own understanding of the Internet - despite even my prior research related to the subject. At any rate, a perhaps a part
    of common knowledge that organization’s of all kinds study internet traffic pertaining to cumbersome number of users across the globe. Blockchain may ultimately be similar in this sense. However, the question of what blockchain technology could be
    used for is rather different in the that sense societal understandings are advancing at remarkably faster rate – perhaps in large part thanks to the Internet. This is a good thing. Oddly, retaining individuals that could be stated as knowledgable
    in terms of deciding what is a good governance Blockchain control for an EO to implement could be.</p>
  <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt appears as though easily accessible documentations developed within open-source communities are advancing subjects related to future applications of Blockchain faster than a comparable rate associated to either advancements
    within academic curriculums and/or to job experiences that can be viewed within resumes. Upon a review of Ethereum Foundation’s Homestead Documentation that is dated March the 1st of 2017, a variety of comprehensive features related to Smart Contracts
    can be identified. Considering the content of the previously stated articles and their respective dates, it’s rather easy to associate terms such as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) as dreamy or even related to a far distant future. However,
    the reality may more so align with Ethereum Foundation’s specifications of a capacity to achieve those terms. This idea could perhaps be conceived as an extraordinary long-term organizational vision.</p>
  <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAssigning a degree of validity to these concepts, it might follow that it’s up to a user to respectfully evaluate both his or hers activities that are permissible within a locale and also the implications of the potential limitations
    of the Blockchain solutions advanced by Ethereum Foundation’s arms-length approaches. An evaluation of a number of Ethereum Documentations could lead to a list of practicable solutions for staff members of nearly any organization to explore. This
    thought is not intended to share a personal perspective of Ethereum Foundation's achievements, but rather highlight what may be one of the most dynamic communities of users advancing practical Blockchain solutions today amongst an even larger external
    wave of private interests in the technology’s commercialization.</p>
  <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn gist, the implication is that EOs may find it necessary to secure talent capable of documenting how existing innovations of Blockchain work, while advancing administrative proposals. While I aspire not to limit the demographic
    EOs to only charities, it does provide a cursory perspective to arguably significant demand. Ultimately, I figured there should be a cumbersome number of staff members associated to EOs that may appreciate this endeavor, and I thought the impact of
    EOs permissible entrances into EVM would be more than ideal from a holistic perspective of community.</p>
  <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSciences for Household Units Institute (SHUI) is an unincorporated not-for—profit buinsess-model that I’ve been developing for a number of years now with a relative of mine. I’m very passionate about furthering its’ administrative
    controls not only with solutions derived from blockchain tech but also with other applications. An overview of SHUI can be reviewed at the following url: https://github.com/Jint-Intj/emblem/blob/master/overview_of_shui.pdf. Prior to discussing in
    more detail background information related to SHUI, I think its’ important to express a few details about its’ current state. SHUI has not received an allotment of gross-receipts in any given fiscal year, and the plan is to strictly continue activities
    within a voluntary capacity building initiative that SHUI adheres to. SHUI does not possess an employee identification number (EIN). I aspire for the red ribbon that surrounds SHUI’s emblem presentation as cut within this to mark the only administrative
    decision that could result in a number comparable to an Employer Identification Number (EIN). The intent is to ensure that SHUI doesn’t receive in its’ name any allotment of gross-receipts or a number comparable to an EIN unknowingly.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspObtaining an EIN effectively start’s a timeline to meet filling requirements often with local and federal offices. The methodologies in which those filing requirements are meet to the best of my knowledge results in internal
    policies – regardless of whether they’re denoted in writing or not. Those controls become subject matters of reviews. There’s also a distinction between mission-oriented activities and administrative activities: such as, accounting, marketing, human
    resources, etc. It’s arguably easier for an EO to receive funding for the former set of activities, because those are the activities it organized to provide. Essentially, maintaining SHUI in its’ state described herein makes it rather easier for me
    to draft controls that could be permissibly replicated by EOs in general within their respective test environments in my opinion. Reporting the results of an experiment is certainly an important part of the scientific method, but it’s arguably more
    important to transparently replicate those results.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBy drafting controls, I figure peers’ evaluations of my drafts could lead to producing equivalent results, or even findings that are dramatically dissimilar to mine. Given shared values towards transparency, even finding that
    are dissimilar to those of mine could markedly advance ideal controls in plain-sight for further review. From an inclusive standpoint of this page’s data, concentrating my emblem’s activities within this context should make strategic management plans
    of all kinds much more approachable for EOs. Progress can be nice.</p>
